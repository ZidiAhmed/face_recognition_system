# Face Recognition System

## Overview
This Face Recognition System is a Python project developed by Ahmed Said, a software engineering enthusiast. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to recognize human faces in real-time using a webcam. It captures facial images, assigns unique serial numbers, and stores them for future recognition.

## Packages Used
1. **cv2 (OpenCV):**
   - Used for accessing and manipulating video streams, capturing frames, and drawing rectangles on detected faces.

2. **face_recognition:**
   - A popular Python library for face recognition. It is built on top of dlib and provides a simple interface for face detection and encoding.

3. **os:**
   - Used for interacting with the operating system, creating directories, and listing files.

4. **datetime:**
   - Utilized for generating serial numbers based on the current date and time.

5. **random:**
   - Used to generate random numbers for serial numbers.

## Why This Project?

### Purpose:
The Face Recognition System aims to provide a simple and extensible platform for recognizing and capturing images of human faces. The system can be used for various applications, including security, attendance tracking, and access control.

### Key Features:
- Real-time face detection and recognition using a webcam.
- Unique serial numbers assigned to each recognized face.
- Storage of facial images for future recognition.
- Automatic capture of images for unknown faces.

### Use Cases:
1. **Security and Access Control:**
   - Enhance security measures by recognizing authorized personnel and granting access based on facial recognition.

2. **Attendance Tracking:**
   - Streamline attendance recording in educational institutions or workplaces by automatically recognizing and recording individuals.

3. **Visitor Management:**
   - Efficiently manage and track visitors by capturing their facial images and generating unique serial numbers.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The system provides a simple and user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring of recognized faces and their serial numbers.

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install required packages using: `pip install opencv-python face_recognition`.
3. Run the `face_recognition_system.py` script.

## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need for a versatile and easy-to-use face recognition system. Special thanks to the open-source community for the development of tools and libraries that make projects like this possible.

Feel free to contribute to the project and make it even more robust!
